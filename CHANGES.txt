== Version 1.1: In Development ==

* Hamcrest Generator now includes JavaDoc and parameter names in generated code
  by using QDox to parse the source code.

* Created hamcrest-core.jar (and removed hamcrest-api.jar).
  Moved core set of matchers (and, eq, not, etc) and assertThat()
  to this package to make it more practical for external libraries
  to embed Hamcrest.

* Created CoreMatchers (static import sugar) in hamcrest-core.jar.

* StringBuilder can use any Appendable (not just StringBuffer).

* Added sensible toString() method to BaseMatcher.

* Created StringDescription.asString() alias (because toString() caused issues
  with static imports).

* TypeSafeMatcher.matchesSafely() is now public.

* Generator recognizes @Factory methods that return subclass of Matcher.
