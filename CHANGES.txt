== Version 1.1: In Development ==

* Created hamcrest-core.jar (and removed hamcrest-api.jar).
  Moved core set of matchers (and, eq, not, etc) to this package to make
  it more practical for external libraries to embed hamcrest.

* Created CoreMatchers (static import sugar) in hamcrest-core.jar.

* StringBuilder can use any Appendable (not just StringBuffer).

* Generator recognizes @Factory methods that return subclass of Matcher.

== Version 1.0: Released Dec 15 2006 ==
