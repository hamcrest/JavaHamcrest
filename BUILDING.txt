--[ Build requirements ]-------------------------------------

* JDK 1.5
  Note: that this is a buildtime dependency for 1.5 specific
  features. However the final built jars should run on 1.4
  and 1.3 JVMs with some features unavailable.

* Ant 1.6 or greater
  To enable testing support, ensure junit.jar exists in
  ANT_HOME/lib.


--[ Building from the command line ]-------------------------

Execute the default ant target:
  ant

This will do a full clean build, run all tests and (if
successful) package up a distribution. The resulting builds
reside in the 'build' directory.

For a list of finer grained build operations:
  ant -projecthelp

The default version number used in the build is 'SNAPSHOT'.
To override this, you can pass a property to ant:
  ant -Dversion=MY.OTHER.VERSION


--[ Building from the IDE ]----------------------------------

It is possible to compile and test the source directly from
popular IDEs, without resorting to the command line.

Steps:
  - Run 'ant library'. This generates additional Java coded
    necessary to compile.
  - Create a new project.
  - Add the following directories as source directories:
      hamcrest-core/src/main/java
      hamcrest-library/src/main/java
      hamcrest-generator/src/main/java
      hamcrest-integration/src/main/java
      build/temp/hamcrest-core/generated-code
      build/temp/hamcrest-library/generated-code
  - Add hamcrest-unit-test/src/main/java as a test directory.
    If this is unsupported by the IDE, add it as another source
    directory.
  - Include all jars in the lib directory in the classpath.
  - Compile as usual in the IDE.
  - If supported, run all tests under org.hamcrest from the
    IDEs JUnit runner.
