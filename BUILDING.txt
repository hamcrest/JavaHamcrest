--[ Build requirements ]---000-------------------------------

* JDK 1.5
  Note: that this is a buildtime dependency for 1.5 specific
  features. However the final built jars should run on 1.4
  and 1.3 JVMs with some features unavailable.

* Ant 1.6 or greater
  To enable testing support, ensure junit.jar exists in
  ANT_HOME/lib.


--[ Building from the command line ]-------------------------

Execute the default ant target:
  ant

This will do a full clean build, run all tests and (if
successful) package up a distribution. The resulting builds
reside in the 'build' directory.

For a list of finer grained build operations:
  ant -projecthelp

The default version number used in the build is 'SNAPSHOT'.
To override this, you can pass a property to ant:
  ant -Dversion=MY.OTHER.VERSION


--[ Building from the IDE ]----------------------------------

It is possible to compile and test the source directly from
popular IDEs, without resorting to the command line.

Steps:
  - Create a new project.
  - Add src/api, src/library and src/integration as source
    directories.
  - Add src/unit-test as a test directory. If this is
    unsupported by the IDE, add it as another source
    directory.
  - Include all jars in the lib directory in the classpath.
  - Compile as usual in the IDE.
  - If supported, run all tests under org.hamcrest from the
    IDEs JUnit runner.
