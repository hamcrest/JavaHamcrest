# Hamcrest Changes

## Version 2.1-SNAPSHOT (Unreleased)

### Overview for 2.1

After a long hiatus without releases, this version simplifies the packaging of

Java 9 module compatibility, along with numerous other improvements and bug
fixes.

### Breaking Changes for 2.1

Although the class API has not changed since Hamcrest 1.3, the way that the
project is packaged has changed. Refer to the [Hamcrest Distributables](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/distributables.html)
documentation for more information.

## Version 1.3 RC2 (22nd October 2010)

* Added FeatureMatcher
* distinguish between instanceOf() and any()

## Version 1.2 (16th May 2009)

* Added mismatch reporting
* Added WithSamePropertyValuesAs matcher
* Moved any() from IsAnything to IsInstanceOf. It now checks the type of the matched object
* Moved MatcherAssert from integration to core
* Tightened up generics.  
* Added IsMapContainingKey and IsMapContainingValue matchers to resolve a 
  generics bug in hasKey and hasValue static factories previously declared
  in IsMapContaining (ngd)
* Added IsCollectionOnlyContaining and IsArrayOnlyContaining which matches 
  collections (and arrays) where all match a given matcher. E.g onlyContains(3,4,5) 
  or onlyContains(lessThan(9))
* text module moved to separate project, hamcrest-text-patterns
* added more colection matchers: xContainingInAnyOrder, xContainingInOrder, xWithSize
* new text Matcher: IsEmptyString
* hamcrest generator uses method return type 

## Version 1.1 (30th June 2007)

* Hamcrest Generator now includes JavaDoc and parameter names in generated code
  by using QDox to parse the source code.
* Created hamcrest-core.jar (and removed hamcrest-api.jar).
  Moved core set of matchers (and, eq, not, etc)
  to this package to make it more practical for external libraries
  to embed Hamcrest.
* Created CoreMatchers (static import sugar) in hamcrest-core.jar.
* StringBuilder can use any Appendable (not just StringBuffer).
* Added sensible toString() method to BaseMatcher.
* Created StringDescription.asString() alias (because toString() caused issues
  with static imports).
* Relaxed isInstanceOf() matcher generic type so it can be used on any kind of
  object. e.g. assertThat(someUnknownObject, isInstanceOf(String.class));
* Added any(Class<T>), null(Class<T>) and notNull(Class<T>) matchers, which returns
  Matcher<T>. Helpful when the compiler struggles with type inference.
* Modified anyOf() and allOf() to accept mixed-types.
* TypeSafeMatcher.matchesSafely() is now public.
* Generator recognizes @Factory methods that return subclass of Matcher.

## Version 1.0 (15th Dececmber 2006)

Initial release.

* Support for namespaces in HasXPath
* Bug fix for matching empty elements with HasXPath
