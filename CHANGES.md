## Version 2.1 (21st December 2018)

### Overview for 2.1

After a long hiatus without releases, this version simplifies the packaging of
Hamcrest into a single jar: `hamcrest-<version>.jar`. Other big changes include
Java 9 module compatibility, migrating the code repository from Google Code to
GitHub, along with numerous other new features, improvements and bug fixes.

### Breaking Changes for 2.1

* The way that the project is packaged has changed. This may cause problems with
correctly upgrading transitive dependencies. Refer to the
[Hamcrest Distributables](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/distributables.html)
documentation for more information, and in particular,
[Upgrading from Hamcrest 1.x](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/distributables.html#upgrading-from-hamcrest-1.x)
* `org.hamcrest.Factory` has been removed. This was only used in old implementations
of the hamcrest build toolchain, and can safely be deleted from client code without
any effect.

* Fix [GH issue #59](https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest/issues/59) - add untyped version of equalTo, named equalToObject
* Fix [GC issue #131](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hamcrest/issues/131) - Implement IsEmptyMap, IsMapWithSize
* Fix [GC issue #187](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hamcrest/issues/187) - IsArray.describeMismatchSafely() should use Matcher.describeMismatch

* Fix [issue #152](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hamcrest/issues/152) - Factory classes missing from matchers.xml
* Fix [issue #144](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hamcrest/issues/144) - OrderingComparison doesn't describe mismatch of comparables that return values other than (-1,0,1)
* Fix [issue #134](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hamcrest/issues/134) - DescribedAs does not delegate describeMismatch

## Version 1.3 RC2 (22nd October 2010)

* Added FeatureMatcher
* distinguish between instanceOf() and any()

## Version 1.2 (16th May 2009)

* Added mismatch reporting
* Added WithSamePropertyValuesAs matcher
* Moved any() from IsAnything to IsInstanceOf. It now checks the type of the matched object
* Moved MatcherAssert from integration to core
* Tightened up generics.  
* Added IsMapContainingKey and IsMapContainingValue matchers to resolve a 
  generics bug in hasKey and hasValue static factories previously declared
  in IsMapContaining (ngd)
* Added IsCollectionOnlyContaining and IsArrayOnlyContaining which matches 
  collections (and arrays) where all match a given matcher. E.g onlyContains(3,4,5) 
  or onlyContains(lessThan(9))
* text module moved to separate project, hamcrest-text-patterns
* added more colection matchers: xContainingInAnyOrder, xContainingInOrder, xWithSize
* new text Matcher: IsEmptyString
* hamcrest generator uses method return type 

## Version 1.1 (30th June 2007)

* Hamcrest Generator now includes JavaDoc and parameter names in generated code
  by using QDox to parse the source code.
* Created hamcrest-core.jar (and removed hamcrest-api.jar).
  Moved core set of matchers (and, eq, not, etc)
  to this package to make it more practical for external libraries
  to embed Hamcrest.
* Created CoreMatchers (static import sugar) in hamcrest-core.jar.
* StringBuilder can use any Appendable (not just StringBuffer).
* Added sensible toString() method to BaseMatcher.
* Created StringDescription.asString() alias (because toString() caused issues
  with static imports).
* Relaxed isInstanceOf() matcher generic type so it can be used on any kind of
  object. e.g. assertThat(someUnknownObject, isInstanceOf(String.class));
* Added any(Class<T>), null(Class<T>) and notNull(Class<T>) matchers, which returns
  Matcher<T>. Helpful when the compiler struggles with type inference.
* Modified anyOf() and allOf() to accept mixed-types.
* TypeSafeMatcher.matchesSafely() is now public.
* Generator recognizes @Factory methods that return subclass of Matcher.
  (Fix by David Saff)

## Version 1.0 (15th Dececmber 2006)

Initial release.

* Support for namespaces in HasXPath
* Bug fix for matching empty elements with HasXPath
