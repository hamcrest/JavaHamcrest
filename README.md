What is Hamcrest?
-----------------
Hamcrest is a library of matchers, which can be combined in to create flexible expressions of intent in tests.

Downloads
---------
You can obtain Hamcrest binaries from [maven central][], or from [google code downloads][].

Binaries
--------
Depending on how you intend to use Hamcrest, you should use different Jars.

  * __hamcrest-core.jar__ -- This is the core API to be used by third-party framework providers. This includes the a foundation set of matcher implementations for common operations. This API is stable and will rarely change. You will need this library as a minimum.
  * __hamcrest-library.jar__ -- The ever-growing library of Matcher implementations. This will grow between releases.
  * __hamcrest-generator.jar__ -- A tool to allow many Matcher implementations to be combined into a single class so users don't have to remember many classes/packages to import. Generates code.
  * __hamcrest-integration.jar__ -- Provides integration between Hamcrest and other testing tools, including JUnit (3 and 4), TestNG, jMock and EasyMock.

Alternatively, if you don't care:

 * __hamcrest-all.jar__ -- Includes all of the above.

Sources and JavaDoc jars are available for all of the above.

Extensions
----------

For Hamcrest extension projects see the [hamcrest extensions page][].

Dependencies
------------
All libraries in the `lib` directory are used at build time, or are optional extras used for tighter integration with third party libraries.

ALL OF THE DEPENDENCIES ARE OPTIONAL.

Documentation
-------------
Documentation can be found on the [google code wiki][].
