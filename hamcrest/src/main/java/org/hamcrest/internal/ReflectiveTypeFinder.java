/**
 * The TypeSafe classes, and their descendants, need a mechanism to find out what type has been used as a parameter
 * for the concrete matcher. Unfortunately, this type is lost during type erasure so we need to use reflection
 * to get it back, by picking out the type of a known parameter to a known method.
 * The catch is that, with bridging methods, this type is only visible in the class that actually implements
 * the expected method, so the ReflectiveTypeFinder needs to be applied to that class or a subtype.
 *
 * For example, the abstract <code>TypeSafeDiagnosingMatcher&lt;T&gt;</code> defines an abstract method
 * <pre>protected abstract boolean matchesSafely(T item, Description mismatchDescription);</pre>
 * By default it uses <code>new ReflectiveTypeFinder("matchesSafely", 2, 0); </code> to find the
 * parameterised type. If we create a <code>TypeSafeDiagnosingMatcher&lt;String&gt;</code>, the type
 * finder will return <code>String.class</code>.
 *
 * A <code>FeatureMatcher</code> is an abstract subclass of <code>TypeSafeDiagnosingMatcher</code>.
 * Although it has a templated implementation of <code>matchesSafely(&lt;T&gt;, Description);</code>, the
 * actual run-time signature of this is <code>matchesSafely(Object, Description);</code>. Instead,
 * we must find the type by reflecting on the concrete implementation of
 * <pre>protected abstract U featureValueOf(T actual);</pre>
 * a method which is declared in <code>FeatureMatcher</code>.
 *
 * In short, use this to extract a type from a method in the leaf class of a templated class hierarchy.
