     * Important terminology:
     *   What EasyMock2 calls 'IArgumentMatcher', Hamcrest calls 'Matchers'.
     *
     * This functionality is available for EasyMock 2.x but NOT EasyMock 1.x.
     *
     * The class extends the standard JUnit TestCase.
     *
     * The additional Hamcrest Matchers can be used by using a static import:
     *   import static org.hamcrest.EasyMockMatchers.*;
     *
     * This provides the Hamcrest library of Matchers through an interface
     * that will provide an adapter to EasyMock IArgumentMatchers and report
     * them to EasyMock as it needs to keep track of them.
